## Fightmate is a web app made for fighting game players.

This is a webtool for helping people how play fighting games such as 'Street Fighter' or 'Fatal Fury' to share commands of the game.
The main tool is a translator, that converts in game language common used by players to icons, this way newer players can also undestand the notation. Also it features export options so it can be used in another contents like videos or posts.

This tool is currently in a WIP state and the main game supported is Fatal Fury City of the Wolves.

## Getting Started to run this tool locally

Install dependencies with your favorite package manager, I did use NPM.

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the developer server
```bash
npm run dev

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Technologies Used

Other icons were created using Photopea.
